Keep it simple

Remember the machines are designed to be hacked

The answer is in front of you just keep calm be cold blooded and take a deep breath.

Move to another machine when the time is over for that part. Come back later

Be prepared. Not in “technical” way, but in moral. Take rest before exam, prepare food you like, have water and snacks on your table.

Take breaks. Go for a little walk.

Document all things on the way. I know that it is very exiting to get root or Domain Admin quickly, especially if you see a path to it, but stop and document all the things.
