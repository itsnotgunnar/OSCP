# OffSec
A repository of useful notes & scripts. In progress.

Most helpful / unique files have been the checklists, nxc.sh, su-checker.sh, setenv.sh, transfer_files.ps1, aliases.sh, tmux.conf, & oneliners.md.

Working on a project to automate much of the AD pentesting process (information gathering in ad.md, random stuff in plan.txt, with temporary code in nxc.py). Goal is to have a program that will help with (if not do) the re-iteration process once you discover new information.

OPSEC not a priority yet.
