DNS Records Defined

	NS: Nameserver records contain the name of the authoritative servers hosting the DNS records for a domain.
	A: Also known as a host record, the "a record" contains the IPv4 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
	AAAA: Also known as a quad A host record, the "aaaa record" contains the IPv6 address of a hostname (such as www.megacorpone.com).
	MX: Mail Exchange records contain the names of the servers responsible for handling email for the domain. A domain can contain multiple MX records.
	PTR: Pointer Records are used in reverse lookup zones and can find the records associated with an IP address.
	CNAME: Canonical Name Records are used to create aliases for other host records.
	TXT: Text records can contain any arbitrary data and be used for various purposes, such as domain ownership verification.

Search for A record.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ host www.megacorpone.com
www.megacorpone.com has address 149.56.244.87
```

Search by DNS record type.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ host -t mx megacorpone.com
megacorpone.com mail is handled by 10 fb.mail.gandi.net.
megacorpone.com mail is handled by 20 spool.mail.gandi.net.
megacorpone.com mail is handled by 50 mail.megacorpone.com.
megacorpone.com mail is handled by 60 mail2.megacorpone.com.
```

If doesn't exist.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ host idontexist.megacorpone.com
Host idontexist.megacorpone.com not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)
```

If we were performing an assessment, we could further extrapolate these results, and might scan for "mail2", "router", etc., and reverse-lookup positive results.

Information gathering has a cyclic pattern, so we'll need to
perform all the other passive and active enumeration tasks on this new subset of hosts to disclose any new potential details.
